    <li>Add the tomato paste. Fill the empty tomato paste can with wine and pour it into the pot. </li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes then fill the empty tomato can with water and add the water to the pot. Use a wooden spoon to press the whole tomatoes against the side of the pot to crush them.</li>
    <li>Next, add the parsley, basil, salt, pepper and bay leaves. Stir well and increase the heat as needed to bring the sauce to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Taste and add additional salt and pepper if needed. If the sauce seems too acidic, add the sugar.</li>
