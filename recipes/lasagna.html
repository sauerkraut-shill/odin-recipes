<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This is our go-to lasagna recipe because it has been called the best by many and has thousands of 5-star reviews! It uses simple ingredients that you likely have on hand, and it packs big flavor! This is an easy lasagna recipe. It requires just one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish. It reheats well and can be made ahead of time. You can freeze lasagna either before or after baking.</p>

<h3>Lasagna Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong>For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauce:</strong>To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>

</ul>

<h3>How To Make Lasagna</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Pasta:</strong>In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong>Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer and bake:</strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How To Layer Lasagna</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
    <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and the cheese mixture, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</p>

<ul>
    <li>sauce – noodles – cheese </li>
    <li>sauce – noodles – cheese </li>
    <li>sauce – noodles – cheese </li>
    <li>noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese</li>
</ul>
